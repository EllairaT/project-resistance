First person tower defence game that has four defenders and one attacker (card
master). Card master can place monsters on the ground in attempt to attack the
defenders and their nexus, which is what they’re trying to defend. Defenders are
equipped with weapons, and must kill monsters deployed by the card master,
earning gold for doing so. They’re able to spend their gold on more ammo and to
purchase building materials. These building materials can be converted into walls
and turrets to help the team defend their nexus. Game ends when attacker kills all
defenders or kill the nexus, or if the defenders reach defend successfully for 15
rounds (15 because → RES15TANCE).
